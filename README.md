**Introduction** 

Humans experience a variety of complex emotions in their daily life. Our language (both written and spoken) reflects these emotions. Online communication media platforms such as forums, social media, and news platforms have many language tracers to identify human emotions. Understanding emotions expressed in languages helps with a wide range of applications including empathetic chatbots, detecting cyberbullying, and recognizing mental issues. The study aims to understand language patterns associated with complex emotions (like anger, fear, sadness, etc) expressed in Reddit platforms using Natural Language Processing techniques to build a system to classify fine-grained emotions. The study intends to explore a large Reddit dataset to develop the state-of-the-art text-based approach to detect multi-class emotions.
